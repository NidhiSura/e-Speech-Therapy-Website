      <h1>Our Vision</h1>
      <p>The COVID-19 Pandemic that hit India around February 2020 affected countless lives, but the underpriviliged were more affected than anyone else. From losing jobs, to
        getting paid for only part-time labor, supporting the education of their children was not the first thing on their minds, as much as simply surviving was. Almost six
        million Indian children are out of school due to the pandemic, as education has taken a back seat. The worst affected out of these are disabled children. With little
        to no access to the special kind of education required for certain disabilities, they are unable to study.</p>
      <p>Further, Speech Therapy is a very niche and expensive form of treatment that not everyone is able to afford, even on a regular basis. There are very few professionals
        train in this treatment, which in turns makes their availability to the underpriviliged very sparse.</p>
      <p>With this project, we aim to give these children a chance to access the resources that are either to expensive for them, or simply too far for them. The only requirement -
        a working computer with an internet connection. We believe in equal opportunity for all, which is why the tool is free of all costs.</p>
